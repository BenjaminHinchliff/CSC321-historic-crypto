TWAS PRILLIG, AND THE SLITHY TOVES 
      DID GYRE AND GIMPLE IN THE WAPE: 
ALL MIMSY WERE THE POROGOVES, 
      AND THE MOME RATHS OUTGRAPE. 

PEWARE THE JAPPERWOCK, MY SON! 
      THE JAWS THAT PITE, THE CLAWS THAT CATCH! 
PEWARE THE JUPJUP PIRD, AND SHUN 
      THE FRUMIOUS PANDERSNATCH! 

HE TOOK HIS VORBAL SWORD IN HAND; 
      LONG TIME THE MANZOME FOE HE SOUGHT 
SO RESTED HE PY THE TUMTUM TREE 
      AND STOOD AWHILE IN THOUGHT. 

AND, AS IN UFFISH THOUGHT HE STOOD, 
      THE JAPPERWOCK, WITH EYES OF FLAME, 
CAME WHIFFLING THROUGH THE TULGEY WOOD, 
      AND PURPLED AS IT CAME! 

ONE, TWO! ONE, TWO! AND THROUGH AND THROUGH 
      THE VORBAL PLADE WENT SNICKER-SNACK! 
HE LEFT IT DEAD, AND WITH ITS HEAD 
      HE WENT GALUMBHING PACK. 

AND HAST THOU SLAIN THE JAPPERWOCK? 
      COME TO MY ARMS, MY PEAMISH POY! 
O FRAPJOUS DAY! CALLOOH! CALLAY! 
      HE CHORTLED IN HIS JOY. 

TWAS PRILLIG, AND THE SLITHY TOVES 
      DID GYRE AND GIMPLE IN THE WAPE: 
ALL MIMSY WERE THE POROGOVES, 
      AND THE MOME RATHS OUTGRAPE.
